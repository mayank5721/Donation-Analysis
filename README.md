# Donation-Analysis
This project involves the analysis and visualization of a large dataset comprising over 68 million records. The project showcases the relationship between the number of projects and donations through interactive scatter plots, as well as the distribution of project types using pie charts. Additionally, a linear model is fitted to understand the correlation between projects and donations. The code utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Cufflinks for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.

Since the files were in GBs they can't be uploaded here.

I'll try to provide seperate link for those files.
